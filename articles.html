                    To systematically evaluate the implementation of various programs, projects, and activities (PPAs) of the three functional divisions of the SDO Biñan City held the Program Implementation Review and Plan Adjustments (PIRPA) last August 7-9, 2024, at Camp John Hay, Baguio City. It is a necessary undertaking to review if goals and performance targets are being met as specified in the Division Education Development Plan (DEDP), Annual Implementation Plan (AIP), and Work and Financial Plans (WFP). It likewise supports the institution’s commitment to provide the members of its organization with opportunities to link their achievements and make a meaningful contribution to the attainment of this institution’s Vision and Mission; promote individual and team growth, participation, and commitment; and grow professionally and personally.
